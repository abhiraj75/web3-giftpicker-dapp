## Description

Gift Picker is a decentralized lottery system built on the **Flare Coston2 testnet**.  
It allows users to participate in a transparent and tamper-proof gift draw, where participants can enter the lottery and the contract owner randomly selects a winner on-chain.

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be used for fair and trustless selection processes, eliminating human bias and centralized control.

This project solves that by:

- Running all logic directly on-chain

- Ensuring transparency: anyone can verify the winner on Flare Explorer  
- Making the process trustless — no third party can interfere
